Using the Sample Application
---------------

The sample application for the book **High Performance ASP.net** is called the **“Surf Store Application”**. It is meant to simulate an eCommerce store and not be too dissimilar from many sites that you see online today. The sample application may also seem rather basic at first, but the key thing is that the web pages contain all the elements that a standard website would have. There is JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and images – all of these make up the components of a webpage front end that we are trying to improve upon.

The ASP.net MVC sample application
---------------

The MVC sample application in this book has been written using ASP.net MVC 4 and the Razor view engine. In many aspects it is almost the same as the ASP.net Webforms sample application, except it has been written to suit the MVC pattern.

The ASP.net Webforms sample application
---------------
Also included with each chapter is a ASP.net Webforms sample application. This has been written using .Net 4 and it should fit the standard pattern of a Webforms application. You will also notice that each file structure contains a **Before and After** folder.

![Folder Structure][1]

The different folders contain the solutions of both the **MVC and Webforms** applications. The Before folder contains the solutions before any optimizations have been applied. This is so that you can run through the example in each chapter and apply the changes. Next, the After folder contains the files after the changes have been applied – this way you can check and compare against the changes you have made.

Each chapter comes with the sample site in both ASP.net Webforms and ASP.net MVC. This way you are able to use whichever part of the ASP.net development framework you are most comfortable with. In order to get up and running using the sample Surf Store application, you will need to have a copy of Visual Studio 2012 or a free copy of Visual Studio Express 2012 which is available to download via the following link - http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/11/en-us/products/express
